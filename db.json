Grease 6 x 20cm/8in loose bottom sandwich cake tins (approximately 4cm/1½in deep) and line the bottoms with greaseproof paper. Dust the tins with flour, then shake out the excess.\r\n\r\nBeat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer or with a handheld electric whisk on a high speed until pale and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low speed and add the eggs bit by bit, mixing on high speed after each addition. Add the vanilla, then add half of the flour. Mix until combined, then add the rest of the flour and mix until you have a smooth cake batter.\r\n\r\nDivide the batter equally between 6 medium-sized bowls and add dashes of each of the food colourings. Mix until you have a pink, yellow, orange, green, blue and purple batter. Pour each colour into one of the prepared tins and bake for approximately 25 minutes, turning after 18 minutes so they colour evenly. Once baked, cool the cakes on a wire rack, then wrap in cling film and store in the fridge.\r\n\r\nTo make the buttercream, place the salted butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Sift the icing sugar on top, bring the mixture together at a low speed, then beat at high speed for a few minutes until the mixture is pale and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and beat to combine.\r\n\r\nRemove the cakes from the fridge and trim the domes off so they are flat. Discard the off cuts. Place the 18cm/7in non-slip mat on the turntable and put the 20cm/8in cake board on top. Put a dab of buttercream on the cake board and place the purple sponge on top. Spread a ¾cm/½in thick layer of buttercream on the top, then place the blue sponge on top. \r\nRepeat this process for the green, yellow, orange and pink sponges until you have assembled the whole cake with five layers of buttercream in between. The final top sponge should have the base facing upward. Gently press the top of the stack to ensure the cake is level and free of air bubbles. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nUsing a knife or a cheese grater, trim the sides of the cake to within a few millimetres of the cake board it’s sitting on. Add a splash of milk to the buttercream and beat for 30 seconds to loosen. \r\nPut 2 spoons of the buttercream on the top of the cake, then spread the buttercream towards the edges and down the sides with a palette knife. Scrape of any excess and discard. This layer should be very thin, almost translucent in parts. Return the cake to the fridge for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nDivide the remaining buttercream into 6 equal portions and place in bowls. Colour the buttercream in the same way you coloured the cake batter, then place each colour into a separate piping bag.\r\n\r\nPut the 25cm/10in non-slip mat on the turntable and place the 30cm/12in cake board on top, along with the cake. Pipe concentric rings of each colour buttercream around the outside of the cake, in the same order as the picture. Add enough pink buttercream to cover the top of the cake. Scrape the excess buttercream off the sides of the cake using the side scraper. \r\nTurn the turntable in a fluid motion while ensuring you keep the blade at a 45 degree angle against the side of the cake with your other hand. Repeat until you have a nice smooth finish.\r\n\r\nUsing your palette knife, carefully brush any excess buttercream that’s gathered at the rim of the cake towards the centre, aiming all the time for sharp edges, straight sides and a flat top. If the buttercream has ‘torn’ in places, dip your palette knife in hot water and use that to smooth over any imperfections. Put the cake back in the fridge for 10 minutes, or until you’re ready for the next stage.\r\n\r\nPut the cake directly on the turntable. Pipe 6 swirls on top of the cake with your remaining colours and sprinkle them with the multi-coloured sprinkles."}}, {"model": "products.recipe", "pk": 2, "fields": {"product": 14, "recipe_title": "Vegan Millionaire's Shortbread", "recipe": "Ingredients\r\n\r\nFor the shortbread\r\n\r\n200g/7oz vegan butter, plus extra for greasing\r\n120g/4½oz caster sugar\r\n250g/9oz plain flour\r\n\r\nFor the caramel\r\n\r\n350g/12oz vegan butter\r\n170g/6oz golden caster sugar\r\n2 x 370g tins vegan condensed milk\r\n2 tbsp maple syrup\r\n\r\nFor the topping\r\n\r\n360g/12½oz vegan dark chocolate\r\n2 tbsp coconut oil\r\npinch sea salt\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3. Grease a 20cm/8in non-stick square tin (it works best with a removable base) with vegan butter.\r\n\r\nTo make the shortbread, cream the vegan butter and sugar together in a large bowl. Sift in the flour and mix well, until a crumbly texture forms. Tip the mixture into the greased cake tin and spread it out evenly with the back of a spoon. Press the shortbread down firmly with your knuckles so that it is tightly packed in the tin. Pierce the biscuit base with a fork, then bake for 20 minutes or until just golden brown. Set aside to cool.\r\n\r\nTo make the caramel, melt the butter and sugar together in a large saucepan over a medium–low heat until the sugar has just dissolved. Stir in the vegan condensed milk and maple syrup and bring to the boil, stirring constantly for 5 minutes until thickened. Pour over the cooled shortbread. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until set before starting to make the chocolate layer.\r\n\r\nTo make the topping, melt the chocolate and coconut oil in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (ensure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water), stirring occasionally. When smooth and glossy, pour over the set caramel layer and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until ready to serve.\r\n\r\nBefore cutting the shortbread, heat a knife in a bowl of hot water to avoid cracking the chocolate layer. First score the top, then slice through the layers. Finish with the pinch of sea salt and enjoy.

Grease and line a 15cm/6in cake tin and a 18cm/7in cake tin. Grease a 15cm/6in oven-proof glass bowl or similar. Cut out a small circle of baking paper to fit in the bottom of the bowl. Flour the sides.\r\n\r\nCream the butter and sugar until it is very pale, light and fluffy.

Fold in the remaining flour with a large metal spoon.\r\n\r\nDivide the mixture between the cake tins and the oven-proof bowl.\r\n\r\nBake for 40-50 minutes, checking the smaller cakes after 30 minutes. The cakes are done when a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.\r\n\r\nRemove from the oven and cool in the tins for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Remove the baking paper carefully.\r\n\r\nFor the decoration, beat the softened butter in a free-standing mixer for 5-8 minutes until very light and soft. Add the icing sugar in gradually, beating all the time, until it is all incorporated. Loosen this buttercream icing mixture with the lemon juice and flavour with honey, to taste. Beat the golden-yellow food colouring into the buttercream icing to achieve your desired shade.\r\n\r\nDust the work surface with icing sugar. Knead the yellow fondant icing until soft and pliable, then roll small amounts of the yellow fondant into rugby balls to form the body of the bees. Knead the black icing until soft and roll out on the dusted work surface into very thin ropes to create stripes. Brush the bees very lightly with water and stick on the stripes. Roll tiny balls of red for noses, and little balls of white with black dots for eyes. Stick these on with a very little water. Push two slices of almond into each bee for wings. Set aside to dry.\r\n\r\nRoll out the white fondant icing and use a daisy cutter to cut out white flowers. Cut small circles from the yellow fondant for the centres of the daisies. Set aside to dry.\r\n\r\nRoll out the green fondant icing to cover the cake board.\r\n\r\nPlace the largest cake on the green lined cake board. Spread a layer of the buttercream on the top, then top with the smaller cake. Spread a little more buttercream on the top and then finish with the round bowl cake.\r\n\r\nSpread a thin layer of buttercream all over the outside of the cake. Set aside to harden (preferably in the fridge) for 10-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nTransfer the remaining buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a plain 2cm/¾in nozzle.

Pulse until the dough starts clumping together in chunks – if it is too dry, add an extra teaspoon of water at a time. Tip out onto a work surface and knead briefly to bring together into a smooth dough. To make by hand, rub the butter and flour together with your fingertips until no big buttery lumps remain. Stir in the sugar, then whisk the egg and water as above and mix in with a cutlery knife until the pastry starts to clump together.\r\n\r\nSplit the pastry into two pieces, with one being a little larger than the other. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nTo make the filling, put the Bramley apples, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a saucepan. Cover with a lid and bring to a simmer over a low–medium heat. Stir occasionally, returning the lid each time, until the apples are very soft. Beat over a high heat to drive off any remaining liquid and smash the apples to a purée. Take the apple purée off the heat and stir in the eating apples and blackberries. Taste for sweetness and, if the blackberries are too sharp, add a tablespoon more sugar.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and preheat a baking tray (or pizza stone). Roll out the bigger piece of pastry on a lightly floured surface until big enough to line a 20–22cm/8–8½in pie dish with an overhang. Add the apple mixture, doming towards the centre, then roll out the second piece of pastry until big enough to cover the dish. Brush a little of the egg white around the pastry rim of the pie, then carefully lift on the top pastry to cover. Press down the edges to seal and trim any overhang with a sharp knife. Poke a few holes in the top of the pie, crimp the edge and decorate with any trimmings, if you like. Use egg white or water to stick on any pastry decorations.\r\n\r\nWhisk the remaining egg white with a fork or mini whisk until bubbly. Lightly brush the bubbly egg white all over the top of the pie and sprinkle heavily with a layer of granulated sugar. Place the pie dish on the preheated baking tray and cook for 10 minutes, then lower the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and bake the pie for a further 35–40 minutes until golden.
